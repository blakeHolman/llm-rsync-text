 (1) Specific Information. This exemption option permits OCAs to identify and select
specific information that should be exempted from the automatic declassification provisions.
The information is described topically in a manner similar to how topics of information are
described in a security classification guide and must fall within one or more of the exemption
categories described in paragraph 13.b. of this section.

 (2) Specific Records. This exemption option permits OCAs to identify and select
specific records for exemption from the automatic declassification provisions. The records must
be described at the records title level and must contain information that is eligible for exemption
under one or more of the exemption categories described in paragraph 13.b. of this section.

 (3) File Series. This exemption option allows OCAs to identify an entire file series that
should be exempted from the automatic declassification provisions. File series shall be

replete with information that almost invariably falls within one or more of the exemption
categories described in paragraph 13.b. of this section.
