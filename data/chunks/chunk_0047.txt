 (3) Formal challenges to classification made pursuant to this section shall include
sufficient description of the information being challenged to permit identification of the
information and its classifier with reasonable effort. Challenges to classification made by DoD
personnel shall also include the reason why the challenger believes that the information is
improperly or unnecessarily classified. The challenge shall be unclassified, if possible.

 (4) Pending final decision on the classification level, the information that is the subject
of a classification challenge will remain classified at its current classification level or the
recommended change level, whichever is higher. The information will continue to be
safeguarded unless and until a decision is made to declassify it.

 (5) The provisions of this section do not apply to information required to be submitted
for prepublication review or other administrative process pursuant to an approved NDA.

 (a) Follow the guidance provided in Paragraph 12 of this enclosure for individuals
who wish to challenge information they believe has been improperly or unnecessarily classified.

 (b) Such challenges are encouraged, and expected, and should be forwarded through
the appropriate channels to the office of primary responsibility.

classification level or at the recommended change level, whichever is higher.

specific information under challenge with reasonable effort.

improperly or unnecessarily classified.
