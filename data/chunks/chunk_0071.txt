 b. U.S. Government documents that include classified FGI shall be marked with
declassification instructions as specified in this enclosure and Volume 2 of this Manual. If these
documents are permanently valuable records of the U.S. Government and are subject to the
25- year automatic declassification rule, the provisions of paragraph 20.a. of this section shall
apply. A U.S. document marked as described herein cannot be downgraded below the highest
level of FGI contained in the document or be declassified without the written permission of the
foreign government or international organization that originated the information. Submit
recommendations concerning downgrading or declassification to the DoD organization that
created the document. If that organization supports the recommendation, it shall consult with the
originating foreign government to determine whether that government consents to
declassification.

 c. DoD officials may consult directly with foreign governments regarding downgrading or
declassification of FGI or seek assistance from the Department of State. In either case, DoD
officials should first consult with the Director, International Security Programs, Defense
Technology Security Administration, OUSD(P), for assistance and guidance.

declassifying and extending classification specified by this enclosure apply to information
