 (1) Media That Is Difficult or Costly to Review. Before the records are subject to
automatic declassification, a DoD Component Head or senior agency official may delay
automatic declassification for up to 5 additional years for classified information contained in
media that make a review for possible declassification more difficult or costly. Prior to taking
such action, officials shall consult with the NDC Director, either through the Component
declassification plan or by memorandum. The Heads of the Military Departments or their senior
agency official shall consult with the NDC Director directly and provide an information copy to
the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Intelligence and Security (DUSD(I&S)). Other DoD
Component Heads or their senior agency official shall consult with the NDC Director through
DUSD(I&S).

 (a) When determined by NARA or jointly determined by NARA and the Department
of Defense, automatic declassification may be delayed for:

 1. Records requiring extraordinary preservation or conservation treatment, to
include reformatting, to preclude damage to the records by declassification processing.

 2. Records that pose a potential menace to health, life, or property due to
contamination by a hazardous substance.

 3. Electronic media if the media is subject to issues of software or hardware
obsolescence or degraded data.

 (b) Information contained in such media that has been referred shall be automatically
declassified 5 years from the date of notification or 30 years from the date of origination of the
media, whichever is longer, unless the information has been properly exempted.
