18. DOWNGRADING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. Downgrading information to a lower
level of classification is appropriate when the information no longer requires protection at the
originally assigned level and can be properly protected at a lower level. The principal purpose of
downgrading is to conserve security resources by avoiding protection of information at too high
a level. Any official with jurisdiction over the information who is authorized to classify or
declassify the information may downgrade it.

 a. Downgrading shall be considered when OCAs are deciding on the duration of
classification to be assigned. If downgrading dates or events can be identified, they shall be
specified along with the declassification instruction. Downgrading instructions do not replace
declassification instructions.

 b. An authorized official making a downgrading decision shall notify all known holders of
the change in classification. If the information is subject to the Scientific and Technical
Information Program (STIP) (DoDD 3200.12 (Reference (bk)), the authorized official shall also
notify the Defense Technical Information Center.

 c. When information is marked for downgrading on a specific date or event and that date or
event has passed, holders shall confirm that the OCA(s) of the information has not extended the
higher classification period prior to downgrading DoD information.

 d. Downgraded information shall be marked as required by Enclosure 3 of Volume 2 of this
Manual.

 e. If a holder of classified information has reason to believe it should not be downgraded as
indicated, the originator shall be notified through appropriate administrative channels. The

document or material shall continue to be protected at the originally assigned classification until
the issue is resolved.
