 DoD INFORMATION SECURITY PROGRAM OVERVIEW

1. PURPOSE. Effective execution of a robust information security program that gives equal
priority to both protecting information and demonstrating a commitment to open Government
and that includes accurate, accountable application of classification standards and routine,
secure, and effective declassification is a national security imperative. This Manual provides
overarching program guidance and direction for the DoD Information Security Program. While
day-to-day program execution is the responsibility of all DoD personnel, program
implementation must be guided by active and engaged senior managers at all levels who have the
responsibility for overall program execution and by security managers who ensure the program is
visible, effective, and efficient.

2. SCOPE. The DoD Information Security Program implements References (b), (d), and (f)
with regard to the classification, declassification, and protection of classified information,
including information categorized as collateral, SCI, and SAP, and provides guidance to users to
identify, mark, and protect certain types of unclassified information, referred to as CUI, in
accordance with Reference (e), Reference (f), and other national-level directives. This combined
guidance is known as the DoD Information Security Program and is applicable to all DoD
Components.
